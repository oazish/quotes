If you’re meditating, if you’re practicing every day, you don’t necessarily see the changes that are taking place in your life because you’re so close to them. You don’t remember how limited your awareness field was six months ago or a year ago, let alone yesterday, before this morning’s meditation. The real miracle, obviously, is the transformation of consciousness from limitation and pain to enlightenment and ecstasy.
