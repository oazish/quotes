He had his first experience of\n      samadhi—complete immersion in infinite planes of light with no sense of\n      self—when he was only three years old. The experience returned when he\n      was 19, leading him to his spiritual adventure and transformation in\n      Nepal, described in his 1995 best-selling book{' '}\n      <a href={SURFING_HIMALAYAS_URL} style={{ color: '#007bff' }}>\n        Surfing the Himalayas\n      </a>.\n\n      There, he encountered a Tibetan Buddhist monk who predicted that Rama\n      would revive an ancient lineage of knowledge and enlightenment and help\n      thousands of people.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Frederick Lenz graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of\n      Connecticut and he received his MA and Ph.D. in English Literature from\n      the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Throughout his\n      twenties, Rama continued to deepen his experience of samadhi–no\n      thought, endless light, infinite awareness. This continued until\n      finally, at age 30, after countless hours of thought-free meditation,\n      he became what is termed “enlightened,” meaning that the mind does not\n      leave the state of infinite mind, yet one remains active and engaged in\n      the world.\n    </p>\n    <hr className=\"mt-5 mb-2\" />\n    <footer className=\"font-italic\">\n      The works of Rama, Dr Frederick Lenz (including writings, talks, and\n      photographs posted on this website) are included here with permission\n      from{' '}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.ramameditationsociety.org/\"\n        style={{ color: '#007bff' }}\n      >\n        The Frederick P.
